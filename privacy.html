<h1>Children Privacy Policy</h1>
Protecting the privacy of children is especially important. The Tactopus website is not intended for children, does not market to children, and does not knowingly collect personal information from children. All references to “children” or “child” in this Children’s Privacy Policy shall mean children under 16 years of age, and all references to the term “parent” shall include legal guardians.
Inside the Play Experience, all play is locally stored, and no Personal Information is collected or solicited from a child user. Our Play Experience contains no external links to third party websites or services
 
The Tactopus Experience is directed at users of all ages, including children. We encourage parents and teachers to supervise their child or student’s use of the Apps and supervise the overall Tactopus Experience. Simply downloading any Tactopus App to your device does not trigger the collection of any personally identifiable information. We only collect information essential for installing necessary administrative updates to your tablet (such as software updates and administrative messages). No Personal Information is collected by Tactopus through the App download process or during the Tactopus Experience. We may collect analytics data (which does not contain Personal Information) from your use of the Service in order to offer and develop the Service, and we may collect information such as age and nickname from you as part of your use of the Apps and the Service and the creation of your user profile.
If the Service is being used by a school and/or teacher (the “Educational Institution”) with students that are under 16 years of age, such Educational Institution agrees that it has reviewed our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy. Tactopus only requests Personal Information from parents and/or teachers and we will never knowingly solicit, nor will we accept, Personal Information from users known to be under 16 years of age. We collect only the minimum amount of information needed about students from teachers, and any such information is used only in connection with the Educational Institution’s use of the Tactopus Experience.
If you are under 16 years of age, then please do not use or access the Website at any time or in any manner. If we learn that personally identifiable information has been provided to us and/or collected on the Website from persons under 16 years of age and without verifiable parental consent, such as through a support request, we take the appropriate steps to delete or hash this information in a secure manner. If you are a parent and discover that your child under 16 years of age has obtained an account on the Website, then you may alert us at hello@tactopus.com and request that we delete that child’s personally identifiable information from our systems. A parent or teacher can visit his or her account online at any time to delete any information and/or the account.
 


<h1>Updates to Our Privacy Policy</h1>
We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Effective Date” at the top of this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to check this page periodically for any updates. If you continue to use the Service following the posting of an updated version of this Privacy Policy, we will treat your continued use as acceptance of the updated version.
If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we may notify you more prominently. If we affect the way we handle Personal Information collected from children users (if applicable), we will first notify and obtain verifiable consent of a parent or legal guardian.
